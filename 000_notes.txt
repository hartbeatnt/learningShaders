///////////////  SHADERS
/*
- Shaders are BLIND and MEMORYLESS
  - each thread has no knowledge of what other threads are doing
  - data flow is strictly unidirectional
  - threads cannot hold state after completing a task

- Like in C, shaders have a single main() function
  - in fragment shaders, main will always return a vec4
    called gl_fragColor that will set the color of the 
    fragment
  - the four values in a color vector represent RBGA

- Like in C, shaders can use pre-processor macros
  - can be used to define global variables
  - can do basic conditional branching

- when defining floats in GLSL, can set precision
  level
  - precision lowp float: low quality, high speed
  - precision mediump float: mid quality, mid speed
  - precision highp float: high quality, low speed

- glsl does not guarantee casting. This means all floats
  must be explicitly defined WITH DECIMAL PLACES
  - float badExample = 4      // ERROR
  - float goodExample = 4.0   // no error

- uniforms: read-only variables that are passed into
  each thread
  - supported types: float, vec2, vec3, vec4, mat2, 
    mat3, mat4, sampler2D and samplerCube.
  - defined at the top after defining default floating
    point precision

- GLSL can take advantage of hardware accelrated angle,
  trigonometric, and exponential functions
    - sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan(), exp(),
      log(), sqrt(), abs(), sign(), floor(), ciel(),
      fract(), mod(), min(), max(), and clamp(),
      step(), smoothstep(), smootherstep(), mix(),

- gl_FragCoord: default input that holds the screen
  coordinates of the fragment
    - this is not a uniform variable, as it will vary
      from thread to thread. 
    - Thus it is a 'varying' type variable
=================
step(), smoothstep(), and smootherstep() 
are used for interpolating

====  smoothstep(edge0, x, edge1)
  /* 
   smoothstep performs smooth interpolation 
   between 0 and 1 
    ----  RULE:
    ------  edge0 < x < edge1.  
   Useful in cases where a threshold function 
   with a smooth transition is desired. 
   
   smoothstep is equivalent to:

                  //  genType is short for 'generic type'
      genType t;  //  Or genDType t for extra precision;
                  //    the D stands for double; 
                  //    default is float;

      t = clamp((x - edge0) / (edge1 - edge0), 0.0, 1.0);
      return t * t * (3.0 - 2.0 * t);

    Results are undefined if edge0 â‰¥ edge1.

vector[0] = vector.r = vector.x = vector.s;
vector[1] = vector.g = vector.y = vector.t;
vector[2] = vector.b = vector.z = vector.p;
vector[3] = vector.a = vector.w = vector.q;

--  .s .t .p and .q are used as vector vales for the
    spacial coordinates of a surface texture
=================
mix() lets you mix two values by percentage
