///////////////  SHADERS
/*
- Shaders are BLIND and MEMORYLESS
  - each thread has no knowledge of what other threads are doing
  - data flow is strictly unidirectional
  - threads cannot hold state after completing a task

- Like in C, shaders have a single main() function
  - in fragment shaders, main will always return a vec4
    called gl_fragColor that will set the color of the 
    fragment
  - the four values in a color vector represent RBGA

- Like in C, shaders can use pre-processor macros
  - can be used to define global variables
  - can do basic conditional branching

- when defining floats in GLSL, can set precision
  level
  - precision lowp float: low quality, high speed
  - precision mediump float: mid quality, mid speed
  - precision highp float: high quality, low speed

- glsl does not guarantee casting. This means all floats
  must be explicitly defined WITH DECIMAL PLACES
  - float badExample = 4      // ERROR
  - float goodExample = 4.0   // no error

- uniforms: read-only variables that are passed into
  each thread
  - supported types: float, vec2, vec3, vec4, mat2, 
    mat3, mat4, sampler2D and samplerCube.
  - defined at the top after defining default floating
    point precision
